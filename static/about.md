Hey there - finally, you found me here. This is my little space in the world wide web where I post stuff about various things that interest or concern me. My main interests are Computer Science and Software Development, Climate Change and IT Security.  

I was born in July 1970 and did a lot of things in my life. As a landscaper, as a musician, as a daddy, as a software developer, as a book author, as a team-lead and as a manager. You will find more about these facts in various pages here.

If you want to get in touch with me, write me an <a href="mailto:post@andy-wenk.de">email</a>. Or you can reach me at:
