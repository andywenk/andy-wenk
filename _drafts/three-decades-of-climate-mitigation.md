## My thoughts on the paper

* Annual Review of Environment and Resources Three Decades of Climate Mitigation: Why Haven’t We Bent the  Global Emissions Curve?
* URL: https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-environ-012220-011104

## General
*  Yet global carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions 1 have been steadily rising over the past three decades and are now 60% higher than they were in 1990
*  While historically most emissions have been released in today’s wealthy, industrialized countries (hereafter referred to as developed countries, following UN terminology), approximately half of the cumulative CO 2 emissions over the past 30 years have been released within so-called developing countries (Figure 1b). However, considering the large proportion of the world’s population within this group [79% in 1990 and 84% in 2018 (1)], the per capita emissions in these countries have, on average, been more than four times lower than in developed countries over this time period (Figure 1c), but with great variations within each group
*  The average per capita emissions in the so-called least developed countries (LDCs) have been 10 times lower than in other developing countries and close to 40 times lower than in developed countries. 
*  Recent research suggests that globally, the wealthiest 10% have been responsible for as much as half of the cumulative emissions since 1990 and the richest 1% for more than twice the emissions of the poorest 50% 
* in just three decades, more fossil CO 2 has been emitted than previously throughout history (804 GtCO 2 in the 240 years 1750–1990 and 872 GtCO 2 in the three decades 1990–2019
* In contrast to the past 12,000 years of relative climate stability, known to geologists as the Holocene, the Anthropocene has been described as an unpredictable and dangerous era in planetary history when humanity has become a major force of nature that is changing the dynamics and functioning of Earth itself 
* Nine thematic lenses
  *  issues of international climate governance (Section 3.1)
  *  the vested interests of the fossil fuel industry (Section 3.2) 
  *  geopolitics and militarism (Section 3.3) 
  *  economics and financialization (Section 4.1) 
  *  mitigation modeling (Section 4.2) 
  *  energy supply systems (Section 4.3)
  *  inequity (Section 5.1)
  *  high-carbon lifestyles (Section 5.2)
  *  social imaginaries (Section 5.3)
*  These lenses were chosen to complement other recent reviews on, for example
   *  carbon lock-ins (16) 
   *  discourses of climate delay (17) 
   *  interdisciplinary research agendas (18,19)

## 3. GOVERNANCE, GEOPOLITICS, AND VESTED INTERESTS (THE DAVOS CLUSTER)

### 3.1. International Climate Governance

* Decision-making through consensus, because of the absence of agreed rules of procedure, is another candidate for criticism, on the grounds that it generates lowest common denominator outcomes and inflates the leverage of small groups of countries (30). More generally, there are varying views in the literature on the relative merits of different types of institutional approaches, including legally binding targets combined with emissions trading for developed countries (as used in the Kyoto Protocol) versus the universal and voluntary policy pledges (as used in the Paris Agreement) (27, 31). Neither of these two approaches has thus far sufficiently impacted the global emissions curve (although it is too early to assess the full impacts of the Paris Agreement).
* A further issue hindering progress has arisen from the deliberate political strategies of interest groups, notably the fossil fuel industry and related sectors (see Section 3.2) and their lobbying to maintain laggard positions in countries such as Australia and the United States and to mute leadership in others, such as Germany. Obstructionism has come from fossil fuel–exporting countries, stalling negotiations, exacerbating political tensions, and avoiding any reference to fossil fuels as the main cause of climate change 
* The nation most significantly undermining the call to action has been the United States
* Critiques of various institutional design features of the climate governance regime have some explanatory value in accounting for the failure to bend the global emissions curve over the past 30 years. However, these critiques appear overshadowed by the effects of deliberate political strategy, unequal power, and the absence of leadership. Despite relative progress in some countries, the wealthy, developed nations have failed to decisively lead in addressing climate change, both in achieving significant emission cuts (9) and providing adequate and predictable finance (28, 29), which could have built trust and impetus for a “race to the top.” This failure to lead in accordance with the principles of the UNFCCC has sowed mistrust and created little incentive for developing countries to act.

### 3.2. The Vested Interests of the Fossil Fuel Industry

* The rapid reduction in emissions necessary to check ongoing climate change poses a real threat to the near- and medium-term business models of incumbent fossil fuel companies and associated vested interests (34). A growing body of literature has outlined how powerful vested interests have developed strategies to both directly discredit the science on climate change and more subtly to delay the need to reduce reliance on fossil fuels (35, 36). Alongside programs of misinformation by hydrocarbon companies (37, 38), such strategies have notably been used by think tanks in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Europe—all with close ties to this industry (39, 40).
* Denouncing climate change as a hoax, scam, or swindle is an old phenomenon, laid bare in the United States from at least 1989 onwards (35). The links between denial of climate change, fossil fuel interests, and conservative think tanks have been revealed in an array of studies over several years (e.g., 39). Organized denial has grown stronger in the United States over the past two decades (35) and was a major theme in Trump’s successful 2016 presidential campaign, with the changing of rules and regulations in favor of the fossil fuel industry during the subsequent presidency (41)
* Research by InfluenceMap (https://influencemap.org) shows how fossil fuel companies have lobbied to weaken climate policies around the world and have continued to do so while claiming to support the Paris Agreement.
* Political lobbying by fossil fuel interests also explains why the Paris Agreement makes no explicit mention of decarbonization or the reduction of fossil fuel use, despite the scientific evidence that holding to 1.5–2°C of warming requires most fossil fuels to remain in the ground (48).

### 3.3. Geopolitics and Militarism

* Everyday military operations directly generate vast emissions of GHGs (58). Recent research found the US military to be the world’s largest institutional consumer of petroleum and emitting more GHGs than most medium-sized countries (59). If the US military were a country, it would be the 55th largest emitter of GHGs in the world, sitting above Portugal, Sweden, and Denmark (59)

## 4. ECONOMICS, MITIGATION MODELING, AND ENERGY (THE ENABLER CLUSTER)

### 4.1. Economics and Financialization

* A primary reason for the ongoing failure to respond to climate change is that markets are predominantly oligopolistic in nature (i.e., dominated by a small number of suppliers). This enables prices to be controlled, in effect divorcing them from resource costs and economic efficiency. In addition, competition in markets incentivizes pushing costs on to others. In this sense, climate change is not the result of a market failure but rather the outcome of a fully functioning capital accumulating economy working hard to shift costs on to others (85), and especially those who lack voice or power (such as the poor, future generations, children, and nonhumans) (see Section 5.1). Within such market structures, straightforward direct regulation of economic production and consumption behavior would be an “effective” means of controlling pollution, but that is not the main goal.
