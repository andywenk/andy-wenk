## Invitation to RubyUnconf 2023

My good former colleague Kartsen Senz, who is a member of the organising team of Rubyunconf Hamburg, invited me to give the keynote for this year's RubyUnconf 2023. I was immensely pleased about this and gladly accepted.

However, far be it from me to talk about technical innovations or "cool shit". Let the people who are still deeply involved in software development do that. Since I was appointed to the management team at sum.cumo (now Sapiens Germany) in 2017, my coding workload has been reduced to a minimum. Sure - I'm still interested in tech. But no longer in the "productive business critical software development" as a developer. 

## So what to talk about?

My goal was to point out some important things that every software developer should be interested in and that they can actively change. This resulted in the title "Responsibility - Simplicity - Sustainability". 

My colleague Nisse at [You Are We](https://www.youarewe.eu){:target="_blank"} has thankfully taken the trouble to write a [blog article at You Are We](https://youarewe.eu/verantwortung-einfachheit-und-nachhaltigkeit){:target="_blank"} after a short interview with me. In it you can read an excellent summary of my keynote.
